# E_commerce_DATABASE
Creating a database for an E-commerce platform that sells various products. The database  store information about products, customers, orders, payments, shipping details, and other relevant data. Additionally, building a reporting system that generates valuable insights for business analysis.

Requirements:
 
1. Database Design:
   - Plan and design the database schema with appropriate tables to store
information about products, customers, orders, payments, shipping details,
and other entities relevant to the E-commerce platform.
   - Establish relationships between tables using primary keys, foreign keys, and
constraints.
 
2. Data Population:
   - Populate the database with realistic sample data for products, customers,
orders, payments, and shipping details.
 
3. CRUD Operations:
   - Implement SQL queries to perform basic CRUD operations on the database,
such as adding new products, updating product details, viewing customer
information, and deleting orders (i.e. Create some stored procedures for the
data flow from one layer to another).
 

4. Advanced Queries:
   - Create SQL queries to retrieve complex information, such as finding
products with the highest sales, calculating the total revenue for a specific time
period, and identifying the most active customers.
 
5. Business needed Views:
   - Design and implement SQL queries to generate various business intelligence
reports, including:
     - Monthly sales View with revenue, number of orders, and top-selling
products.
     - Customer loyalty view, showing the number of repeat customers and their
purchase history.
     - Shipping performance view, analysing average delivery times and tracking
delayed orders.
 
6. Data Analysis:
   - Utilize SQL queries to analyse customer behaviour, such as identifying the
most popular product categories and regions with the highest sales.
 
7. Security:
   - Implement security measures, such as user roles and permissions, to restrict
access to sensitive data.
 
8. Transactions and Rollbacks:
   - Demonstrate the use of transactions to ensure data consistency and the
ability to roll back changes in case of errors.
 
9. Optimization:
   - Optimize SQL queries for performance by creating appropriate indexes and
evaluating query execution plans.

 
10. Data Backup and Recovery:
    - Set up a backup and recovery strategy for the database to prevent data
loss.
 
This project covers a wide range of SQL topics, including database design, data
manipulation, views, advanced queries, subqueries, stored-procedure, data
analysis, security, transactions, and optimization. It will provide interns with
valuable hands-on experience in working with a real-world scenario and help
them build a strong foundation in SQL and database management.
 
Remember to document your work thoroughly, explaining the database
structure, queries, and any assumptions made during the project.
